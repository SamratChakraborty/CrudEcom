Project Overview:

This project is a React application built with Tailwind CSS, utilizing React hooks, React Router, and local storage for state management. It provides a foundation for developing web applications with a efficient state handling.

Features:

Tailwind CSS Integration: Tailwind CSS is integrated into the project, offering a utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs with ease. It allows for rapid prototyping and consistent styling across the application.
React Hooks: The application utilizes React hooks such as useState, useEffect, useContext, etc., for managing component state and side effects. Hooks provide a concise and intuitive way to handle stateful logic within functional components.
React Router: React Router is employed for client-side routing, enabling navigation between different views/components within the application. It offers a declarative approach to routing and integrates seamlessly with React applications.
Local Storage: Local storage is utilized for client-side persistence of data. It allows the application to store and retrieve data locally on the user's device, enabling a seamless user experience even after page refreshes or browser restarts.
